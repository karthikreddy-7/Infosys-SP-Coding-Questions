|----------|-------------|--------|
| **1.** | **Minimum Coins Required**<br>Given an array `coins[]` of size `N` and a target value `V`, where `coins[i]` represents the coins of different denominations. You have an infinite supply of each of coins. The task is to find minimum number of coins required to make the given value `V`. If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: `coins[] = {25, 10, 5}`, `V = 30`<br>Output: Minimum 2 coins required. We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents.<br>Input: `coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}`, `V = 11`<br>Output: Minimum 2 coins required. We can use one coin of 6 cents and one coin of 5 cents.| [Click here to see the code](https://github.com/karthikreddy-7/Infosys-SP-Coding-Questions/blob/main/MinCoinChange.java) |
| **2.** | **Subset Sum**<br>Given a set of non-negative integers and a value `sum`, the task is to check if there is a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to the given `sum`. <br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: `set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}`, `sum = 9`<br>Output: True<br>Explanation: There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.<br>Input: `set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}`, `sum = 30`<br>Output: False<br>Explanation: There is no subset that adds up to 30.| [Click here to see the code](https://github.com/karthikreddy-7/Infosys-SP-Coding-Questions/SubsetSum.java) |
