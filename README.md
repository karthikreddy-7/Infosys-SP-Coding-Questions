1. Given an array `coins[]` of size `N` and a target value `V`, where `coins[i]` represents the coins of different denominations. You have an infinite supply of each of coins. The task is to find minimum number of coins required to make the given value `V`. If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.

Examples:  
Input: `coins[] = {25, 10, 5}`, `V = 30`
Output: Minimum 2 coins required. We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents. 
Input: `coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}`, `V = 11`
Output: Minimum 2 coins required. We can use one coin of 6 cents and one coin of 5 cents.
