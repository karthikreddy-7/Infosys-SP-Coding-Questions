|----------|-------------|------|
| **1.**   | **Minimum Coins Required**<br>Given an array `coins[]` of size `N` and a target value `V`, where `coins[i]` represents the coins of different denominations. You have an infinite supply of each of coins. The task is to find minimum number of coins required to make the given value `V`. If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: `coins[] = {25, 10, 5}`, `V = 30`<br>Output: Minimum 2 coins required. We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents.<br>Input: `coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}`, `V = 11`<br>Output: Minimum 2 coins required. We can use one coin of 6 cents and one coin of 5 cents.| [Click here to see the code](https://github.com/karthikreddy-7/Infosys-SP-Coding-Questions/blob/main/DynamicProgramming/MinCoinChange.java) |
| **2.**   | **Subset Sum**<br>Given a set of non-negative integers and a value `sum`, the task is to check if there is a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to the given `sum`. <br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: `set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}`, `sum = 9`<br>Output: True<br>Explanation: There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.<br>Input: `set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}`, `sum = 30`<br>Output: False<br>Explanation: There is no subset that adds up to 30.| [Click here to see the code](https://github.com/karthikreddy-7/Infosys-SP-Coding-Questions/blob/main/DynamicProgramming/SubsetSum.java) |
| **3.**   | **Largest Number**<br>Given an array of strings arr[] of length n representing non-negative integers, arrange them in a manner, such that, after concatenating them in order, it results in the largest possible number. Since the result may be very large, return it as a string.<br><br>**Examples:**<br>Input: `n = 5`, `arr[] = {"3", "30", "34", "5", "9"}`<br>Output: "9534330"<br>Explanation: Given numbers are {"3", "30", "34", "5", "9"}, the arrangement "9534330" gives the largest value.<br>Input: `n = 4`, `arr[] = {"54", "546", "548", "60"}`<br>Output: "6054854654"<br>Explanation: Given numbers are {"54", "546", "548", "60"}, the arrangement "6054854654" gives the largest value.| [Click here to see the code](https://github.com/karthikreddy-7/Infosys-SP-Coding-Questions/blob/main/Greedy/LargestNumber.java) |
